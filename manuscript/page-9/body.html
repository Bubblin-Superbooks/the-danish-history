   Originally written in Latin in the early years of the 13th
   Century A.D. by the Danish historian Saxo, of whom little is
   known except his name.
   The text of this edition is based on that published as
   "The Nine Books of the Danish History of Saxo Grammaticus",
   translated by Oliver Elton (Norroena Society, New York, 1905).
   This edition is in the PUBLIC DOMAIN in the United States.
   This electronic edition was edited, proofed, and prepared by
   Douglas B. Killings.
   The preparer would like to thank Mr. James W. Marchand and Mr.
   Jessie D. Hurlbut for their invaluable assistance in the
   production of this electronic text.  Thank you.  I am indebted to
   you both.
   Although Saxo wrote 16 books of his "Danish History", only the
   first nine were ever translated by Mr. Oliver Elton; it is these
   nine books that are here included.  As far as the preparer knows,
   there is (unfortunately no public domain English translation of ) </p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>  </blockquote></div> </div>
