Conquerors sometimes show their magnanimity (like Harald Godwineson by offering to bury their dead foes. )</p><p>The buried "barrow-ghost" was formidable; he could rise and slay and eat, vampire-like, as in the tale of Asmund and Aswit. He must in such case be mastered and prevented doing further harm by decapitation and thigh-forking, or by staking and burning.
